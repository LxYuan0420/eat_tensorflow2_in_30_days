The Python functions are not able to be embedded into the static graph, so these Python functions are not calculated during the calling after the graph creation; in contrast, TensorFlow functions are able to be embedded into the graph. Using Python functions is causing unmatched outputs between the \"eager execution\" before the decoration by @tf.function and the \"execution of static graph\" after the decoration by @tf.function.\r\n",

In fact, TensorFlow throws error in most of such cases.\r\n",
