        "The callbacks in tf.keras is a class, usually specified as a parameter when use model.fit. It provides the extra operations at the starting or the ending of training, each epoch or each batch. These operations include record some log information, change learning rate, early termination of the training, etc.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Likewise, this callbacks parameter is also able to be specified for model.evaluate or model.predict, providing extra operations at the starting or the ending of the evaluation, prediction, or each batch. However this method is rarely used.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "For the most cases, the pre-defined callbacks in the sub-module keras.callbacks are sufficient. It is also possible to define child class inheriting keras.callbacks.Callbacks to customize callbacks if necessary.\r\n",

        "All the classes of callbacks are inheriting keras.callbacks.Callbacks, which contains two attributes: params and model.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "What's more, there is an extra argument logs in the certain methods of the callbacks classes, such as on_epoch_begin, on_batch_end.

These logs variables are able to transfer among the functions with the same name in these callbacks classes.\r\n",

This callback is automatically applied to every Keras model and is applied first.\r\n",
